<p class="p">一，<strong class="ph b">&nbsp;</strong><strong class="ph b">概述</strong></p>
<p class="p">美术(Fine art)泛指与实用工具不同的，为了美学或概念而发展的任何艺术形式。此种艺术经常表现为使用可见或表演性的形式来创作艺术品，例如绘画&nbsp;painting,&nbsp;雕刻&nbsp;sculpture,&nbsp;舞蹈&nbsp;dance,&nbsp;戏剧&nbsp;theatre,&nbsp;建筑&nbsp;architecture,&nbsp;摄影&nbsp;photography&nbsp;和版画&nbsp;printmaking。一些学校和研究机构仍然使用“美术”来形容传统的学术意义上的艺术形式。</p>

<p class="p">这是伦勃朗Rembrandt成熟期的作品之一，嘴角的深锁与眼神的痛苦，成功呈现出了不安的气氛出来。梵高曾面对伦勃朗的画说过，“你知道吗，我只要啃着硬面包在这幅画的前面坐上两个星期，那么即使少活十年也甘心。”这就是&nbsp;伟大的艺术不朽的魅力。</p>

<p class="p">二，背景</p>
<p class="p">美术中的美(fine)指的不是艺术品的美丑质量，而是原则上的纯正。亚里士多德在《诗学》(参见附注)中认为诗的起源有两个原因：摹仿的本能；音调感和节奏感。都本于人的天性而非柏拉图所谓灵感的作用。这个传统的定义把一些可见艺术形式排除在外，比如被视为工艺品(craftwork)或应用艺术(applied
art)的纺织品&nbsp;(textiles)，而在现代，随着众多媒介上的高级技艺的涌现，美术的现代定义更加广泛。fine art在英文中也被用来指某人的高超技艺。
 美术和应用艺术的区别，主要是起源于英国工艺美术运动的支持者(如William Morris，主张把群众技艺纳入艺术范畴)和早期现代主义派(如Virginia
Woolf和Bloomsbury学派，极力保持艺术的排他与神秘)的争论。</p>
<p class="p">人们经常误会美术就是表演艺术(音乐舞蹈戏剧)。不过在经院定义中，美术是一门学科，包括传统美术、设计和表演艺术，甚至文学创作(creative
writing)也被认为是一门美术。</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">二，二维工作</strong>&nbsp;Two dimensional work </p>
<p class="p">2.1&nbsp;插图&nbsp;Illustration：</p>
<p class="p">插图是为了突出主题而创作的可见艺术形式，如绘图、绘画、相片等。目的是通过提供可视图形来阐述或装饰文本(如故事、诗歌或新闻)的信息。</p>

<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Francisco_de_Goya_y_Lucientes_100_c.JPG?attredirects=0" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Francisco_de_Goya_y_Lucientes_100_c.JPG?attredirects=0</a>Goya,1795, Self-Portrait</p>
<p class="p">Drawing is a form of visual expression and is one of the major
forms within the visual arts. Common instruments include graphite
pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals,
chalk, pastels, markers, stylus, or various metals like silverpoint.
There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including cartooning.
Certain drawing methods or approaches, such as “doodling” and other
informal kinds of drawing such as drawing in the fog a shower leaves
on a bathroom mirror, or the surrealist method of “entopic graphomania,”
in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet
of paper, and lines are then made between the dots, may or may not
be considered as part of “drawing” as a “fine art.” Drawings in blood
may be denied Artistic Status</p>
<p class="p">2.3&nbsp;漫画&nbsp;Comics</p>
<p class="p">Comics are a graphic medium in which images are utilised in order
to convey a sequential narrative. Comics are typically seen as a low
art[5][6][7][8][9][10], although there are a few exceptions, such
as Krazy Kat[11] and Barnaby. In the late 20th and early 21st century
there has been a movement to rehabilitate the medium.</p>
<p class="p">2.4&nbsp;版画和成像&nbsp;Printmaking and imaging</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Melencolia_I.jpg?attredirects=0" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Melencolia_I.jpg?attredirects=0</a>Melencolia I, 1514, Dürer</p>
<p class="p">Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing, normally
on paper. Except in the case of monotyping, the process is capable
of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print.
Each piece is not a copy but an original since it is not a reproduction
of another work of art and is technically known as an impression.
Painting or drawing, on the other hand, create a unique original piece
of artwork. Prints are created from a single original surface, known
technically as a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates
of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone,
used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts
and fabric plates for screen-printing. But there are many other kinds,
discussed below. Works printed from a single plate create an edition,
in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited
edition. Prints may also be published in book form, as artist's books.
A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques. </p>

<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Bellocq_Storyville_undamaged.jpg?attredirects=0" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Bellocq_Storyville_undamaged.jpg?attredirects=0</a>Bellocq</p>
<p class="p">Fine Art Photography refers to photographs that are created to
fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands
in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography. Photojournalism
provides visual support for stories, mainly in the print media. Fine
art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s
vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes. The
work of Ansel Adams in Yosemite and Yellowstone provides an example.
Adams is one of the most widely recognized fine art photographers
of the 20th century, and was an avid promoter of conservation. While
his primary focus was on photography as art, his work raised public
awareness of the beauty of the Sierra Nevada and helped to build political
support for their protection.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">三，雕塑</strong>&nbsp;Sculpture</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/50px-Kolkhoznitsa.jpg?attredirects=0" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/50px-Kolkhoznitsa.jpg?attredirects=0</a>V Mukhina Kolhoznitsa 1937</p>
<p class="p">Sculpture is three-dimensional artwork created by shaping hard
or plastic material, commonly stone (either rock or marble), metal,
or wood. Some sculptures are created directly by carving; others are
assembled, built up and fired, welded, molded, or cast. Because sculpture
involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it
is considered one of the plastic arts. The majority of public art
is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a garden setting may be
referred to as a sculpture garden.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">四，观念艺术</strong>&nbsp;Conceptual Art</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Oak_tree.jpg?attredirects=0" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Oak_tree.jpg?attredirects=0</a>An Oak Tree by Michael Craig-Martin. 1973</p>
<p class="p">Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved
in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material
concerns. The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict
and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional
visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation
as text. However, through its association with the Young British Artists
and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly
in the UK, developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does
not practise the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.[12]</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">五，舞</strong>&nbsp;Dance</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Morris.dancing.at.wells.arp.jpg?attredirects=0" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/100px-Morris.dancing.at.wells.arp.jpg?attredirects=0</a>Morris dancing</p>
<p class="p">Dance is an art form that generally refers to movement of the body,
usually rhythmic and to music,[13] used as a form of expression, social
interaction or presented in a spiritual or performance setting. Dance
is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see
body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, patterns of behaviour
such as a mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (the leaves danced
in the wind), and certain musical forms or genres. In sports, gymnastics,
figure skating and synchronized swimming are dance disciplines while
martial arts kata are often compared to dances.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">六，剧院</strong>&nbsp;Theatre</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/150px-Royal_Opera_House_and_ballerina.jpg?attredirects=0" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://sites.google.com/site/deepcast/Home/base/artbase/150px-Royal_Opera_House_and_ballerina.jpg?attredirects=0</a>The Royal Opera House, London</p>
<p class="p">Modern Western theatre is dominated by realism, including drama
and comedy. Another popular Western form is musical theater. Classical
forms of theatre, including Greek and Roman drama, classic English
drama including Shakespeare and Marlowe and French theater including
Molière is still performed today. In addition, performances of classic
Eastern forms such as Noh and Kabuki can be found in the West, although
with less frequency.  Fine arts film is a term that encompasses high
quality motion pictures and the field of film as an fine art form.
A fine arts movie theater are venues, usually a building, for viewing
such movies. Films are produced by recording images from the world
with cameras, or by creating images using animation techniques or
special effects. Films are cultural artifacts created by specific
cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.
Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular
entertainment and a powerful method for educating — or indoctrinating
— citizens. The visual elements of cinema gives motion pictures a
universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide
attractions by using dubbing or subtitles that translate the dialogue.
 Cinematography is the discipline of making lighting and camera choices
when recording photographic images for the cinema. It is closely related
to the art of still photography, though many additional issues arise
when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion. Independent
filmmaking often takes place outside of Hollywood, or other major
studio systems. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially
produced without financing or distribution from a major movie studio.
Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed
to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st
century.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">七，建筑</strong>&nbsp;Architecture</p>

<p class="p">Architecture is frequently considered a fine art, especially if
its aesthetic components are spotlighted [in contrast to structural-engineering
or construction-management components]. Architectural works are perceived
as cultural and political symbols and works of art. Historical civilizations
are often known primarily through their architectural achievements.
Such buildings as the pyramids of Egypt and the Roman Colosseum are
cultural symbols, and are an important link in public consciousness,
even when scholars have discovered much about a past civilization
through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify
themselves with (and are known by) their architectural monuments.[14]</p>
<p class="p">八，其他</p>
<p class="p">Western art music is a performing art and frequently considered
a fine art.  Avant-garde music is frequently considered both a performing
art and a fine art.  Electronic Media (perhaps the newest medium for
fine art, since it utilizes modern technologies such as computer hardware
and software from production to presentation. Includes amongst other
things video, digital photography, digital printmaking and interactive
pieces).  Textiles, including quilt art and “wearables” or “pre-wearables”
are frequently considered fine art if part of an art display</p>

<p class="p">“Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is
the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections
of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed
by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations
gave birth to Poetry.” -Aristotle</p>
