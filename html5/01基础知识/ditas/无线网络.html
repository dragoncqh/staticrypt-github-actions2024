<p class="p">概述</p>
<p class="p">无线网络是使用无线电做为其载波或者物理层的电话或者计算机网络</p>
<p class="p">Types</p>
<p class="p">Wireless&nbsp;LAN</p>
<p class="p">One type of wireless network is a WLAN or Wireless Local Area Network.
Similar to other wireless devices, it uses radio instead of wires
to transmit data back and forth between computers on the same network.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><p class="p">Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi is a commonly used wireless network in computer
systems which enable connection to the internet or other machines
that have Wi-Fi functionalities. Wi-Fi networks broadcast radio waves
that can be picked up by Wi-Fi receivers that are attached to different
computers or mobile phones.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Fixed Wireless Data: Fixed wireless data is a type of wireless
data network that can be used to connect two or more buildings together
in order to extend or share the network bandwidth without physically
wiring the buildings together.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Wireless MAN</p>
<p class="p">A type of wireless network that connects several Wireless LANs.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><p class="p">WiMAX: WiMAX is the term used to refer to wireless MANs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Mobile devices networks</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><p class="p">Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM): The GSM network
is divided into three major systems which are :the switching system,
the base station system, and the operation and support system (Global
System for Mobile Communication (GSM)). The cell phone connects to
the base system station which then connects to the operation and support
station; it then connects to the switching station where the call
is transferred where it needs to go (Global System for Mobile Communication
(GSM)). This is used for cellular phones, is the most common standard
and is used for a majority of cellular providers.[3]</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Personal Communications Service (PCS): PCS is a radio band
that can be used by mobile phones in North America. Sprint happened
to be the first service to set up a PCS.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">D-AMPS: D-AMPS, which stands for Digital Advanced Mobile Phone
Service, is an upgraded version of AMPS but it is being phased out
due to advancement in technology. The newer GSM networks are replacing
the older system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Uses</p>
<p class="p">Wireless networks have had a significant impact on the world as
far back as World War II. Through the use of wireless networks, information
could be sent overseas or behind enemy lines easily and quickly and
more reliably. Since then wireless networks have continued to develop
and its uses have significantly grown. Cellular phones are part of
huge wireless network systems. People use these phones daily to communicate
with one another. Sending information over seas is possible through
wireless network systems using satellites and other signals to communicate
across the world. Emergency services such as the police department
utilize wireless networks to communicate important information quickly.
People and businesses use wireless networks to send and share data
quickly whether it be in a small office building or across the world.[4]</p>
<p class="p">Another important use for wireless networks is as an inexpensive
and rapid way to be connected to the Internet in countries and regions
where the telecom infrastructure is poor or there is a lack of resources,
like most developing countries.</p>
<p class="p">Compatibility issues also arise when dealing with wireless networks.
Different components not made by the same company may not work together,
or might require extra work to fix compatibility issues. Wireless
networks are typically slower than those that are directly connected
through an Ethernet cable.</p>
<p class="p">A wireless network is more vulnerable because anyone can try to
break into a network broadcasting a signal. Many networks offer WEP
- Wired Equivalent Privacy - security systems which have been found
to be vulnerable to intrusion. Though WEP does block some intruders,
the security problems have caused some businesses to stick with wired
networks until security can be improved. Another type of security
for wireless networks is WPA - Wi-Fi Protected Access. WPA provides
more security to wireless networks than a WEP security set up. The
use of firewalls will help with security breaches which can help to
fix security problems in some wireless networks that are more vulnerable.</p>
<p class="p">Environmental concerns and health hazard</p>
<p class="p">In recent time there are increased concerns and research linking
usage of wireless communications with poor concentration, memory loss,
nausea, premature senility and even cancer.[5] Questions of safety
have been raised, citing that long term exposure to electromagnetic
radiation of the sort emitted by wireless networks may someday prove
to be dangerous.[6]</p>
